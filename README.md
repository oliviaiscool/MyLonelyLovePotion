# My Lonely Love Potion
## Description:
You're a lonely little witch whose horde of cats no longer want to be around you. Your bitter, angry, and all out of peanut butter icecream. Your last resort? Total destruction!

An HTML5 game with Phaser.js :) 

## Game Design:
### Objective
Chase your kittens through Central Park on your magic broomstick, shooting rays of warm heart-felt feelings to get them to slow down enough for you to catch them. Get enough smitten kittens on your side to unlock *feline frenzy* so you can finally complete your plans of world domination! AHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!

### Gameplay Mechanics
Witch flies up and down on her broom, automatically shooting hearts from the tip of her broomstick. As kittens are hit, they slow down in speed. Pick up cans of peanut butter ice cream along to way to keep your optimism high! When your optimism becomes less than 65%, your warm rays of love will start becoming ice, cold arrows of depression. Don't let them hit your kitties or they'll attack you! Also, make note to avoid the police...

### Level Design
Infinite-runner style, bushes scroll to give the impression of moving on a static city skycraper background. 

### Controls/Input
* Keyboard controls (W-A-S-D)
